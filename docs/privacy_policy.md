*   **Run Command (`com.termux.permission.RUN_COMMAND`)**: Required to execute commands in the Termux app to install and launch Linux distributions. This is the core functionality of FluxLinux.
*   **Foreground Service (`android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE`)**: Used to keep the "Floating Keyboard" toggle button active while you are using a Linux environment.
*   **Display Over Apps (`android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW`)**: Required to display the floating button that allows you to toggle the keyboard while using X11/GUI environments.

## 3. Third-Party Services

FluxLinux interacts with the following third-party services/apps to function:

*   **GitHub**: When you choose to install a distribution or tool, the app downloads files directly from GitHub releases. Please refer to GitHub's privacy policy for data handling regarding downloads.
*   **Termux & Termux:X11**: FluxLinux acts as an orchestrator for these applications. We rely on them to run the Linux environment. Please refer to their respective privacy policies.
