## App Details

**FluxLinux** is an Android app that provides a complete Linux desktop environment (XFCE) inside Termux. It supports multiple distributions including Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and Arch Linux.

### Key Features
- One-click Linux installation with XFCE desktop
- Floating keyboard button (via AccessibilityService)
- Full proot-based environment (no root required)
- Multiple distro support

### Notes on `scanignore`
The following asset archives are bundled for **user-facing features** and are **not** used during the F-Droid build process:

| Archive | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `assets/busybox/Busybox for Android NDK-*.zip` | **Magisk module for root users.** Provides essential Unix commands (`wget`, `curl`, `tar`, etc.) for enhanced root terminal functionality. Users flash this via Magisk to extend their root shell capabilities. |
| `packages/android-sdk-tools-static-aarch64.zip` | **ARM64 Android build tools** (aapt, aapt2, zipalign, etc.). Required for the in-app Android development stack (`setup_appdev_debian.sh`) since official SDK ships x86-only binaries that don't run on ARM64 proot. Source: [lzhiyong/android-sdk-tools](https://github.com/lzhiyong/android-sdk-tools). |
| `assets/xfce4/icons/papirus-icon-theme-*.tar.gz` | GPLv3 Papirus icon theme for XFCE desktop |
| `assets/xfce4/theme/theme.zip` | GTK theme files for XFCE |
| `assets/xfce4/cursor/cursor.zip` | Vimix cursor theme (GPLv3) |
| `assets/wallpaper/wallpaper.zip` | Desktop wallpapers |

All archives are extracted at runtime by the user, not during F-Droid's build.
